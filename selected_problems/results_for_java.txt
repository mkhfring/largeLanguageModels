Each player moves to an adjacent node in each turn. If both players reach a node at the same time, Fennec wins. Determine the winner of the game.

Input for p1:
The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) — an edge in the tree.

***Data Id 877: p1: This code solves the problem of finding the minimum cost of buying two types of products (x and y) in a store where there is a discount on buying both products together (ab).

Input: 5 4 3 2 1
Output: 6

Explanation: 
a=5, b=4, ab=3, x=2, y=1
Since ab*2 > a+b, we can't get the discount by buying both products together. So, we will buy them separately.
Therefore, the cost will be a*x + b*y = 5*2 + 4*1 = 10 + 4 = 14.
But, if we had got the discount, then we would have paid only ab*2 = 3*2 = 6.

Final result is: 0

Explanation: Code2 doesn't solve p1, so we return 0.+++

Output:
60

Explanation:
Here, A costs 10 and B costs 20. If both products are bought from the same shop, a discount of 30 is applied. So, the minimum cost would be 60, which is the sum of buying A and B from different shops.

Final result is: 1

Output:
Output either "Snuke" or "Fennec" depending on who is closer to the center of the tree. If they are equidistant, output "Snuke".

Example:
Input:
4
1 2
2 3
2 4

***Data Id 591: p1: The code1 solves the problem of dividing candies equally among three children, where each child has a certain number of candies and we want to know the minimum number of additional candies needed to be distributed so that each child has the same number of candies.

Input for code1: 
3 5 7

Output for code1:
3

Explanation: Initially, the number of candies each child has is [3, 5, 7]. We can add 2 candies to the first and second child so that the number of candies becomes [5, 7, 7]. Now, we can subtract 5 from each child so that the final number of candies becomes [0, 2, 2]. Therefore, we need a minimum of 3 additional candies to distribute equally among the three children.

***Data Id 641: p1: The code1 solves a problem of calculating the minimum number of votes required to win an election with n candidates, where each candidate has a certain number of votes. The output is the minimum number of votes required to win the election.

Input:
3
5 2
7 3
10 5

Output:
35

Explanation:
There are 3 candidates with the following number of votes: (5,2), (7,3), and (10,5). To win the election, a candidate needs to have more than half of the total votes. In this case, the total number of votes is 22. Therefore, the candidate needs at least 12 votes to win. The minimum number of votes required to win the election is the least common multiple of the number of votes of the winning candidate. In this case, the winning candidate has 10 votes, so the minimum number of votes required to win is 30. However, this is not enough because the winning candidate needs to have more than half of the total votes. Therefore, the minimum number of votes required to win is 35.

***Data Id 407: p1: Given an array of integers, calculate the total distance between adjacent elements and the first and last elements.

1 2 4 6 8

Output:
19
17
13
11
15

Explanation:
The total distance for the original array is 19 (1-2-4-6-8). If we remove and replace the second element (2) with the first element (1), the total distance becomes 17 (1-1-4-6-8). Similarly, if we remove and replace the third element (4) with the second element (2), the total distance becomes 13 (1-2-2-6-8). Continuing this process for all elements in the array, we get the output array [17, 13, 11, 15].

It then returns the total number of additional votes needed.

Input:
3
5 2
7 3
10 5

Output:

Explanation:
There are 3 candidates and the first candidate received 5 votes, the second candidate received 7 votes, and the third candidate received 10 votes. The minimum number of additional votes needed for the first candidate to win is 1, for the second candidate is 3, and for the third candidate is 0. Therefore, the total number of additional votes needed is 1+3+0=4. Since the candidates need to receive whole numbers of votes, the first candidate needs 6 votes and the second candidate needs 10 votes. Therefore, the total number of additional votes needed is 6-5+10-7=4+3=7.

When i=1 and j=2, we have (3-1)*2 + 1*(4-2) = 6+2 = 8 which is not equal to k=7. When i=2 and j=2, we have (3-2)*2 + 2*(4-2) = 2+4 = 6 which is not equal to k=7. When i=3 and j=2, we have (3-3)*2 + 3*(4-2) = 0+6 = 6 which is not equal to k=7. When i=0 and j=0, we have (3-0)*0 + 0*(4-0) = 0+0 = 0 which is not equal to k=7. When i=1 and j=0, we have (3-1)*0 + 1*(4-0) = 0+4 = 4 which is not equal to k=7. When i=2 and j=0, we have (3-2)*0 + 2*(4-0) = 0+8 = 8 which is not equal to k=7. When i=3 and j=0, we have (3-3)*0 + 3*(4-0) = 0+12 = 12 which is not equal to k=7. Therefore, the answer is No.

Explanation: 
In the first test case, there are three traffic lights at positions 10, 12, and 10. Since two of them are at the same position, the output is 0. In the second test case, there are four traffic lights at positions 10, 12, 13, and 15. There are no two traffic lights with the same color, so we can use all of them. The minimum distance between any two traffic lights is between the ones at positions 12 and 13, which are two units apart. In the third test case, there are two traffic lights at positions 1 and 24. Since there are no traffic lights between them, the minimum distance is 23. In the fourth test case, there are two traffic lights at positions 1 and 2. Since they are adjacent, the minimum distance is 1. In the fifth test case, there are two traffic lights at positions 2 and 1. Since they are adjacent, the minimum distance is 1.

4 8
0

Output for code1:
OK
OK
2

Final result is: 0

Explanation: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first integer represents the given value t. The next integer represents the number of pairs of numbers n. The next n pairs of integers represent the two sets of numbers. The code calculates the absolute difference between the pairs and adds them up. If the sum is greater than or equal to t, it prints "OK". Otherwise, it prints the difference between t and the sum.

The first test case has t=3 and n=3. The pairs are (1,2), (2,4), and (3,6). The differences are 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The sum is 6, which is greater than t, so it prints "OK".

The second test case has t=4 and n=4. The pairs are (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), and (4,8). The differences are 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The sum is 10, which is greater than t, so it prints "OK".

The third test case has t=0, which signals the end of input. The code exits the loop and terminates.

p1 and code2 have different problem statements, so the final result is: 0.

Explanation: Code2 solves a problem of finding the index of the element in an array that is closest to a given value. The input consists of three integers: N, T, and A, followed by N integers representing the elements of the array. The code calculates the difference between each element and a target value, and returns the index of the element with the smallest absolute difference.

Since p1 and code2 have different problem statements, the outputs for the same input will not be identical. Therefore, the final result is: 0.+++

***Data Id 445: p1: The code1 solves a problem related to calculating the cost of connecting blocks. Given an array of integers, the cost of connecting two blocks is the product of their sum and their distance. The task is to find the total cost of connecting all blocks in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
345

Explanation:
The optimal way to connect the blocks is to connect the first and last blocks, then connect the second and second-last blocks, and so on. The cost of connecting the first and last blocks is (1+5)*1 = 6, the cost of connecting the second and second-last blocks is (2+4)*2 = 12, and the cost of connecting the third block to itself is (3+3)*3 = 18. Therefore, the total cost is 6+12+18 = 36. However, this is not the final answer because we need to multiply it by the factorial of the number of blocks, which is 5! = 120. Therefore, the final answer is 36*120 = 345.

***Data Id 230: p1: Given a graph with n nodes and m edges, and q queries, each query consists of a source node, a destination node, and a TTL (time to live) value. For each query, the program should output the minimum number of edges that need to be traversed to reach the destination node from the source node, given that each edge takes one unit of time and the TTL value limits the maximum number of units of time that can be spent to reach the destination node.

Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), the number of nodes in the graph. The nodes are numbered from 1 to n. The next n lines describe the edges of the graph. The i-th line starts with two integers ri and ki (1 ≤ ri ≤ n, 0 ≤ ki ≤ n − 1), where ri is the number of the i-th node and ki is the number of edges that start from the i-th node. The next ki integers on the same line are the numbers of the nodes that can be reached from the i-th node. The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4), the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains three integers s, d, and TTL (1 ≤ s, d ≤ n, 0 ≤ TTL ≤ 100), where s is the source node, d is the destination node, and TTL is the time to live.

Output:
For each query, output a line containing the minimum number of edges that need to be traversed to reach the destination node from the source node, or "NA" if it is impossible to reach the destination node within the TTL.

1 3 10

Output:
9

Explanation:
There are 3 cities and the cost of transportation by train and bus is 2 and 3 respectively. The distance between the cities is 1, 3, and 10. The minimum cost to travel between all cities is calculated as follows:
- The cost of traveling from city 1 to city 2 is 2 * (3 - 1) = 4
- The cost of traveling from city 2 to city 3 is 3 * (10 - 3) = 21
- The total cost is 4 + 21 = 25
- The minimum cost is the cost of traveling by bus between all cities, which is 3 * (10 - 1) = 27. Therefore, the minimum cost is 27 - 25 = 2.
- The output is 9, which is the sum of the minimum cost and the cost of traveling by bus between all cities.
