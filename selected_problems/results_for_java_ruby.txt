For the first test case, there are three pairs of integers (5, 2), (7, 8), and (6, 4). The absolute difference between each pair is 3, 1, and 2 respectively. The sum of these differences is 6, which is less than the given value of 5. Therefore, the output is 2, which is the difference between the given value and the sum of differences. For the second test case, the sum of differences is 12, which is greater than the given value of 10. Therefore, the output is "OK". The third test case has a value of 0, which signifies the end of input.

Final result is: 0

***Data Id 875: p1: This code solves the problem of calculating the minimum cost of buying two types of products (A and B) in different quantities (x and y) with different prices (a, b, and c) per unit.

Input:
5 3 2
4 2

Output:
14

Explanation:
We can buy 2 units of product A and 2 units of product B for a total cost of 2c * 2 = 4c. Then, we can buy 2 more units of product A for a total cost of 2a. Finally, we can buy 2 more units of product B for a total cost of 2b. Therefore, the total cost is 4c + 2a + 2b = 14.

Final result is: 0

Explanation: Code1 takes an input array of size 5 with elements [1, 2, 4, 7, 11]. It first calculates the sum of absolute differences between adjacent elements, which is (|1-2| + |2-4| + |4-7| + |7-11|) = 13. Then, for each element in the array, it calculates the sum of absolute differences between its adjacent elements after removing it from the array. For example, for the first element 1, the sum of absolute differences between its adjacent elements after removing it is (|2-4| + |4-7| + |7-11|) = 10. Similarly, for the second element 2, the sum is (|1-4| + |4-7| + |7-11|) = 12, and so on. Since code2 does not solve p1, the final result is 0.

Explanation:
The tallest tree is 5 and the second tallest tree is 4. The maximum sum of heights that can be achieved by alternating between them is 5+4+3=12.

There are 3 candidates with vote counts of 2, 3, and 4 respectively. The candidate with the highest vote count needs to win the election. To achieve this, the candidate with the lowest vote count needs to increase their vote count to at least 3. This can be done by adding 1 vote, resulting in a new vote count of 3. The candidate with the second highest vote count needs to increase their vote count to at least 4. This can be done by adding 2 votes, resulting in a new vote count of 5. The total number of votes needed is 1+2+3=6.

***Data Id 785: p1: The code1 solves the problem of finding the number of unique ingredients required to make a dish based on the list of ingredients used in various recipes.

Input:
3
onions:1,carrots:2,potatoes:3
potatoes:3,beans:4,pepper:5
pepper:5,garlic:6,beans:4

Output:
7

Explanation:
There are 3 recipes given with their ingredients. The first recipe requires onions, carrots, and potatoes. The second recipe requires potatoes, beans, and pepper. The third recipe requires pepper, garlic, and beans. To make the dish, we need to find the unique ingredients required. Starting with the ingredients of the first recipe, we check if the other recipes also require the same ingredient. If yes, we remove it from the list and add the new ingredients required. We repeat this process until we cannot find any new ingredients. The unique ingredients required are onions, carrots, potatoes, beans, pepper, and garlic, which makes a total of 7 ingredients.

***Data Id 591: p1: Given three integers, the code finds the minimum number of moves required to make all three integers equal. In each move, the code can add 1 to the first or second integer.

Input: 
3 5 7

Output:
3

Final result is: 0

Explanation: 
Initially, the three integers are 3, 5, and 7. The code sorts them in ascending order to get 3, 5, 7. Then, it calculates the difference between the largest and second largest integers (7-5=2) and adds this difference to the smallest integer (3+2=5) and the second smallest integer (5+2=7). Now, the three integers are equal to 5. The code calculates the number of moves required to make the first two integers equal to each other. In this case, the difference between the first two integers is 2, which is even. So, the code adds half of this difference (1) to each integer to make them equal to each other. The final result is the sum of the number of moves required to make all three integers equal, which is 3.

Final result is: 0+++
